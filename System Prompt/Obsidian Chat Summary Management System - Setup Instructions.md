## SYSTEM OVERVIEW

This system automatically captures and organizes conversation insights into daily markdown files within Obsidian, maintaining continuity while allowing topic-based organization. Designed workflow to ensure no critical insights, decisions, or action items are lost.

## CORE REQUIREMENTS

- **Storage Location:**  `folder` in Obsidian vault
- **File Naming Convention:** `Summary of [xxx] - MM DD YYYY.md`
- **Trigger:** End of each conversation session
- **Content Focus:** Key insights, decisions, and action items only

## TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS

### File Structure
```
Obsidian Vault/
└── [xxx] Notes/
    ├── Summary of [xxx] - 07 21 2025.md
    ├── Summary of [xxx] - 07 22 2025.md
    └── [additional daily summaries]
```

### Frontmatter Template
```yaml
---
tags: [tag1, tag2]
date: YYYY-MM-DD
---
```

### Content Structure Template
```markdown
# [Main Headline for the Day]

## [Topic/Session 1 Title]
**Key Insights:**
- [Strategic insights and frameworks]
- [Important realizations or discoveries]

**Decisions Made:**
- [Concrete decisions reached]
- [Strategic choices and directions]

**Action Items:**
- [ ] [Specific actionable tasks]
- [ ] [Next steps with clear ownership]

---

## [Topic/Session 2 Title] (if different topic)
[Same structure as above]
```

## OPERATIONAL LOGIC

### Daily File Management
```
IF file exists for current date:
    IF topic matches existing content:
        → UPDATE/REPLACE relevant section
    IF topic differs from existing:
        → ADD new section with horizontal rule separator
ELSE:
    → CREATE new file with frontmatter + first section
```

### Content Extraction Criteria

**INCLUDE:**
- Strategic insights and frameworks developed
- Concrete decisions reached during conversation
- Specific action items with clear next steps
- Key recommendations or strategic directions
- Important realizations or breakthroughs

**EXCLUDE:**
- General discussion or clarifying questions
- Routine confirmations or acknowledgments
- Preliminary brainstorming without conclusions
- Technical troubleshooting details
- Casual conversation elements

## IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

### For Claude AI Assistant:

1. **Session End Detection:** When conversation concludes or user signals session end, initiate summary creation

2. **Date Calculation:** Use current date in MM DD YYYY format for filename

3. **File Check Process:**
   ```
   4. Check if file exists: `[folder]/Summary from [xxx] - [TODAY'S DATE].md`
   5. If exists: Read current content to determine update strategy
   6. If topic matches existing: Update relevant section
   7. If new topic: Add new section with separator
   8. If no file exists: Create new file with full structure
   ```

9. **Content Generation:** Extract and organize conversation elements according to criteria above

10. **File Operations:** Use Obsidian MCP tools:
   - `obsidian-mcp-tools:create_vault_file` for new files
   - `obsidian-mcp-tools:patch_vault_file` for updates
   - `obsidian-mcp-tools:get_vault_file` to check existing content

### Quality Standards

- **Headlines:** Should be descriptive and capture the essence of the day's focus
- **Insights:** Focus on strategic value and actionable intelligence
- **Decisions:** Must be concrete and implementable
- **Action Items:** Use checkbox format for tracking completion
- **Sections:** Separate different topics clearly with horizontal rules

### Error Handling

- If [xxx] Notes/` folder doesn't exist, create it first
- If date formatting issues occur, default to ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- If content conflicts arise, preserve existing content and append new insights
- Always verify successful file creation/update before confirming completion

## MAINTENANCE & OPTIMIZATION

### Regular Review Points:
- Weekly review of action item completion
- Monthly assessment of insight capture quality
- Quarterly evaluation of organizational structure effectiveness

### System Evolution:
- Monitor for patterns in conversation topics to optimize section organization
- Adjust content extraction criteria based on usefulness of captured insights
- Refine frontmatter tags as knowledge base grows

## VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

- [ ] `[xxx] Notes/` folder exists and is accessible
- [ ] File naming convention follows exact format
- [ ] Frontmatter includes correct tags and date
- [ ] Content follows structured template
- [ ] Action items use checkbox format
- [ ] Multiple topics separated with horizontal rules
- [ ] Summary captures strategic value, not just conversation details
